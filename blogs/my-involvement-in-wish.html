        I first discovered the Women Involved In Software & Hardware (WISH) club
        in my freshman year. Throughout the year, I attended their general
        meetings, events, and trips. I really liked the community of people
        there and decided to apply for a leadership position for the following
        year.

        My sophomore year, I was part of the Mentorship team, which was in
        charge of WISH's mentorship program. As a team, we planned bonding
        events, fun themed meetings and outings, and also helped plan several
        general meetings. I sincerely enjoyed getting to work together with this
        team and grow as a leader while improving my communication and
        organization skills.

        This school year, I serve as the Graphic Designer. I am in charge of
        creating all of our graphics as well as managing our social media
        accounts. I also had the opportunity to design new merchandise for our
        club, which will help us do a bit of fundraising. In this role, I've
        gotten the chance to sharpen my skills in design, planning, and time
        management.
